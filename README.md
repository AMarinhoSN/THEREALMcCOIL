# THEREALMcCOIL 

THE REAL McCOIL is a Markov chain Monte Carlo method that estimates complexity of infection and population allele frequencies using SNP data obtained from Sequenom or similar types of SNP assays.  

We used the data in two ways: 

1. categorical method, in which we considered SNP to be heterozygous or homozygous

2. proportional method, in which the relative signal intensity for each allele is used.
